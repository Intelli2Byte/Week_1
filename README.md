# PlasticClassifier : Advanced CNN for Waste Sorting.
Plastic pollution is a big global problem, and sorting waste correctly is key to solving it. This project uses a CNN model to sort plastic waste into different types, making automated waste management easier . 

 # Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Waste Classification Data by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

# Key Details:
Total Images: 25,077
Training Data: 22,564 images (85%)
Test Data: 2,513 images (15%)
Classes: Organic and Recyclable
Purpose: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal

# Approach:
Reviewed various waste management strategies and relevant white papers.
Examined the composition of household waste.
Divided the waste into two categories: Organic and Recyclable.
levearaged  IoT and machine learning to automate the waste classification process.
